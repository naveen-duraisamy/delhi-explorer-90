# Nebula

Nebula provides a template repository for
[`@drupal-canvas/create`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@drupal-canvas/create)
to scaffold a new codebase for working with
[Drupal Canvas Code Components](https://project.pages.drupalcode.org/canvas/code-components).
The codebase serves as a development environment fully set up with tooling and
examples for AI-assisted development workflows.

## Getting started

Instead of cloning this repository, create a new project interactively:

```
npx @drupal-canvas/create@latest
```

## AI-assisted development

[Agent skills](https://agentskills.io) are located in `.agents/skills/`.

- `nebula-*` skills provide conventions and workflows specific for this
  repository.
- `canvas-*` skills are generic Canvas Code Component component guidance
  installed from
  [`drupal-canvas/skills`](https://github.com/drupal-canvas/skills).

### Setup

No setup is required for the following coding agents; they read directly from
`.agents/skills/`: Amp, Codex, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Kimi Code CLI,
OpenCode. (This list can become outdated quickly; by the time you read this,
additional coding agents may already standardize on this directory.)

If your coding agent does not standardize on this directory (for example, Cursor
or Claude Code), manually symlink the relevant skill from `.agents/skills/`:

```bash
# For Claude Code
ln -s .agents/skills/<skill-name> .claude/skills/<skill-name>

# For Cursor
ln -s .agents/skills/<skill-name> .cursor/skills/<skill-name>
```

### Adding new skills

Install new skills from [skills.sh](https://skills.sh). For example:

```bash
npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills
```

### Updating skills

Update the Drupal Canvas skills by re-adding and selecting all of them:

```bash
npx skills add drupal-canvas/skills
```

Once [vercel-labs/skills#337](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills/issues/337)
is resolved, you'll be able to use the `npx skills check` and
`npx skills update` to check for and apply updates more efficiently.
